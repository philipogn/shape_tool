plan:
- recognize shape
- crop image to show just the shape
- preprocess image
- categorize sign

issues:
- issues with circles, sometimes they are detected with 4 or 8 sides
    - with cv2.approxPolyDP(), it approximates the contour using straight lines, so a circle is approximated as a many sided polygon
      depending on blur, edge quality, and epsilon value
    - fix check roundness/circularity of the shape 
    - kind of works but unreliable depending on resolution of image resulting in jaggedness and blur preprocessing
